This code generates a PDF report from a CSV file containing pizza order details, utilizing pandas for data analysis and fpdf for generating the report. It loads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, calculates total orders, total pizzas sold, and the most ordered pizza through data analysis, and then creates a PDF report with the extracted statistics. The report is formatted with Arial font, bold and centered title, and line breaks, including cells with the calculated statistics. Finally, the code saves the PDF report to a specified output path and prints a success message to the console, providing a comprehensive solution for generating a PDF report from pizza order data.
